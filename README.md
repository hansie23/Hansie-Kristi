# Project 2: [Dog Breed Prediction](https://hansie23-dog-breed-classifier.hf.space)
* **Objective:** Developed a machine learning model to classify dog breeds from images using TensorFlow.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit.
* **Data Preprocessing:**
  * Sourced from Kaggleâ€™s Dog Breed Identification challenge.
  * Contains thousands of labeled images categorized into 120 dog breeds.
  * Applied image augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, zooming, shifting) to enhance model generalization.
  * Utilized batch processing for efficient memory usage and training optimization.
* **Model Architecture:** Leveraged transfer learning using the MobileNet_V2 model (https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/5).
* **Training:** 
  * Trained the model using the augmented dataset.
  * Used categorical cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer.
  * Monitored performance on a validation set for hyperparameter tuning and overfitting prevention.
* **Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance on a separate test set and using a custom function to evaluate the predicted dog breed with the actual dog breed.
* **Result:** * High accuracy in classifying dog breeds and effective generalization to new, unseen images due to image augmentation.
* **Deployment:** * Deployed the model as a web app using Streamlit.
* **Outcome:** * Demonstrated the potential of transfer learning in image classification tasks with numerous categories. Gained experience in data preprocessing, image processing and transfer learning.
