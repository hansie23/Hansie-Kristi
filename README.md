# My Portfolio

# Project 1: [Web scrapper](https://github.com/hansie23/dog-breed-prediction-webapp)
* Used Python, BeautifulSoup and Pandas
* It loads the Indeed job site at the provided URL and parses the content
* Scrapes each webpage for job title, company name, location and salary
* The information is saved in '.csv' file.

# Project 2: [Data Analysis of Red Wine](https://github.com/hansie23/data-analysis-of-red-wine)
* Used Python, Jupyter notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn
* Performed data analysis of red wine to segregate them based on quality
* Plotted bar graphs, scatter plots, learning curve graphs and heatmaps
* Found multi-colinearity in the data. Generated a 2-component PCA projection and visualization
* Trained and tested a logistic regressing model gaining 98% accuracy.

# Project 3 (Part 1): [Dog Breed Prediction Notebook](https://github.com/hansie23/dog-breed-prediction-notebook)
* Used Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlob, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Tensorflow Hub
* Turned images to tensors and then converted the data into batches
* Used the neural network model MobileNet V2 from Tensorflow Hub
* Created callbacks for Tensorboard and early stopping
* The model takes dog image as input and give the predicted dog breed as output.

# Project 3 (Part 2): [Dog Breed Prediction Webapp](https://github.com/hansie23/dog-breed-prediction-webapp)
* Used Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, Numpy and Tensorflow
* Created a client facing web app to interact with the dog breed prediction model
* Created flask API for preprocessing and prediction of a dog image given as input
