# Project 2: Data Analysis of Red Wine
* Used Python, Jupyter notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn
* Performed data analysis of red wine to segregate them based on quality
* Plotted bar graphs, scatter plots, learning curve graphs and heatmaps
* Found multi-colinearity in the data. Generated a 2-component PCA projection and visualization
* Trained and tested a logistic regressing model gaining 98% accuracy

# Project 3: Dog Breed Prediction Notebook
* Used Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlob, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Tensorflow Hub
* Turned images to tensors and then converted the data into batches
* Used the neural network model MobileNet V2 from Tensorflow Hub
* Created callbacks for Tensorboard and early stopping
